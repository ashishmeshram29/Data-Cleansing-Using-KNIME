# Data-Cleansing-Using-KNIME
      KNIME is a low-code data science and data preparation platform that makes understanding data and designing analytic workflows accessible to everyone. The KNIME suite includes two tools: KNIME Analytics Platform is a desktop-based tool where analysts and developers construct workflows.

     Here i've used KNIME for data cleaning purpose. I had a CSV file from google maps about shops in Nanded. It also has a details about shop addresses and phone number along with other no so useful data . My goal was to remove unnecessary columns and also to keep only rows that consist of phone number.

     As, i had used a chrome extension to scrape data from google map and store in CSV file , the extension was no so powerful to format perfect data in CSV file. The shop's opens-closed timing where added into phone number column so i also had to remove such rows.

    With KNIME it was easy to do the task.
