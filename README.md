# Data-Cleansing-Using-KNIME
 Here i've used KNIME for data cleaning purpose. I had a CSV file from google maps about shops in Nanded. It also has a details about shop addresses and phone number along with other no so useful data . My goal was to remove unnecessary columns and also to keep only rows that consist of phone number.
